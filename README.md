# Passion project Gwen Bogaert
Personal passion project voor school - expert creative development

## Client
I chose to realise this project for the JEF Festival (European Youth Festival). The end user will be the festival-visitors and to be more specific young visitors (starting from the age of 4).

## Core project statement
To develop this project, I will mainly use a pose estimation / tracking technology (PoseNet) as the core technology to stimulate the interactivity and movement. The project will be an interactive game where "upside down" will be reflected in both the theme and the layout of the game. While playing, the player will be able to control the game with their hands and feet to collect objects and thus reach the goal of the game. The game-development aspect is made using Phaser.io. 
Since this is made for a younger target audience, the game will provide the necessary audio guidance/ story-line. 

The research question boils down to: how can I use a pose estimation / tracking technology to offer an educational and interactive experience to the young visitors of the JEF festival?

## At-home versie
This installation will have an 'at-home' (toned down) version as well. This version will be online and accessible for everyone with a webcam and internet access. 
With 'toned-down version' it implies that this version will only focus on playing with their hands, this to provide an _easier_ experience.
